        <h2>Assignment 6</h2>

        <p>Text visualizations became more popular with the growing amounts 
            of digitized, textual data. These kinds of visualizations explain 
            relations between textual entities, abstract and summarize text passages
            and aim for giving users information about the text to help them find
            relevant text passages more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>In this exercise, you will focus on the implementation and data preparation for 
            <b>word clouds</b>. 
        </p>

            <h3>Word Clouds</h3>
            <p>A Word Cloud is a nice, yet imprecise way to have a look at the textual contents
                of our data. To get an overview of the movies in our movie database, we will create
                one Word Cloud per genre based on the movie descriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a first step, you will implement the word cloud using the library <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a>. 
                An example 
                of how to use it can be found on <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/word-cloud">Observable</a>. 
                As always, you are not allowed to copy the function, but you can take inspiration from 
                it and adapt it to your needs. 
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 1: Word Cloud Implementation (40%)</h3>
                <p>Implement the missing parts of the word cloud implementation in the <code>wordcloud.js</code>. 
                    Your implementation will automatically be feed with the fake data given in the 
                    <code>index.js</code>, such that you can test. The fake data will be replaced in <b>Task 3</b>
                    with real data from film descriptions.

            <h3>Word Vectors</h3>
            <p>In order to create most text-based visualizations, first we need to transform 
            each input document - the movie's description in our case - to a word vector. 
            </p>
            <p>
            There are several ways to define a word vector. In the lecture, you have been
            introduced to the sparse version. To safe the browsers internal memory, we will use 
            the dense representation. In this representation, the word and its value is stored.
            Let's consider the following example of a well known film quote: <i>"Bond. James Bond."</i>. 
            The dense word vector using word count as value would look like this: 
            <i>[["Bond", 2], ["James", 1]]</i>, since the term <i>Bond</i> figures two times in the quote, while 
            <i>James</i> occurs only once.</p>
            <p> 
            The word count is a simple measure, but it emphasizes common words like <i>and</i> since these 
            words have a high word count. To mitigate that, we will use the <i>tf-idf</i> score
            instead. The score expresses, how much a term helps to distinguish one document from 
            any other document.</p>
            <p>In the <i>tf-idf</i> score, <i>tf</i> stands for term frequency and is the word count 
            weighted by the total number of words in the document, aka movie description: <br>
            <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd4f8a91dd0d28a11c00c94a13a315a5b49a8070"/>,<br>
            <i>f</i>  is the word count of a term <i>t</i> in document <i>d</i>.
            </p> 
            <p>
            <i>idf</i> stands for the inverse document frequency and is calculated 
            by counting the number of documents, the term occurs in, weight it by the overall number
            of documents and invert the result. To ensure that frequent terms are weighted less, usually
            the log of the inverse document frequency is used: <br>
            <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac67bc0f76b5b8e31e842d6b7d28f8949dab7937"/><br>
            where <i>N</i> is the total number of documents in corpus <i>D</i> and <i>t</i> is again the term/word.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <i>tf-idf</i> is then calculated by multiplying <i>tf</i> and <i>idf</i>:<br>
                <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10109d0e60cc9d50a1ea2f189bac0ac29a030a00"/><br>
            
            The formulas are taken from the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf page on Wikipedia</a>. 
            I have also prepared an Observable page that shows an 
            <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/11e84bd9a759f575">example of how to calculate the tf-idf scores</a>.
            </p>


            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 2: Word Vectors (40%)</h3>
                <p>Transform each of the given movie's descriptions to a dense word vector 
                    using the tf-idf score. For this, first calculate all <i>idf</i> values
                    by completing the <code>inverseDocumentFrequency</code> function in the 
                    <code>wordvector.js</code>file. It will fill a map, in which the idf 
                    value for each term of the corpus is stored. </p>
                    <p>
                    In a second step complete the <code>tfidf</code> function in the 
                    <code>wordvector.js</code>file, which
                    is supposed to transform a movie description, that has already been broken 
                    into single words, 
                    to a dense word vector. </p>
                    <p>
                    Once the tf-idf score is implemented,
                    the visualization below shows the 15 words 
                    with the highest tf-idf scores for 10 movies.
                    For now it shows the first 15 words in the movie's description.
                    You can use it to check your implementation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you like to compare numbers, this would be the first 5 entries of the correct word vector of the film <b>Four Rooms</b>:
                    [
                    [
                        "bellhop",

                        "evening",
                        0.31
                    ],
                    [

            <h3>Word Cloud Preparation</h3>
            <p>Now, lets connect <b>Task 1</b> and <b>Task 2</b>! Using the function for tf-idf in 
                combination with the word cloud function, 
                we can now explore the most frequent words used in the descriptions of films per 
                genre. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 3: Word Cloud preparation (20%)</h3>
                <p>Calculate the tf-idf scores for all film descriptions per genre in 
                    the <code>main.js</code>.</p>
                    <p>For this, first generate a word array for each genre by concatenating the word arrays 
                        of that genre's movies.</p> 
                    <p>Then calculate first the idf 
                    values of all words of using the genre word arrays and finally the word 
                    vectors with tf-idf values.</p>
                    <p>To visualize the data, insert your calculated data into the 
                        <code>wordcloud</code> function in the <code>index.js</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The list of genres is
