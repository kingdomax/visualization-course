      <h2>Assignment 2</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This assignment is meant to introduce you to the task
        of <i>exploratory visual analytics</i>. It is your task 
        to explore the provided database about weather stats from 
        stations throughout Germany using and extending the 
        techniques you used in the last assignment with the
        <emph>vega-lite-api</emph>.</p>
        <p>Once you finish your work, you delete the npm_packages 
          folder (you can recreate it by simply calling "npm install"
          on the command line), zip this folder and upload it to the 
          exercise on the Moodle page. 
        </p>

        <h3>Extend your vega-lite-api skills</h3>
        <p>Work through the remaining Observable pages of the <emph>vega-lite-api</emph>:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/scales-axes-and-legends?collection=@uwdata/visualization-curriculum">Scales, Axes, and Legends</a></li>

            <h3>Task 1: Learn more about the vega-lite-api</h3>
            <p>
              Extend your skill set and train it with mini tasks given on 
              each Observable page.

      <h3>Questions to the dataset</h3>
      <p>Before you get started, take a look at the csv file
        under <code>data/daily_climate_summary_no_missing_identical_first_entry.csv</code>
        and think of three questions you would like to know from 
        the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, formulate questions that can be answered by a visualization and
        do not ask the same kind of question twice. So if you asked 
        "is there a relation between PRESSURE_AIR and TEMPERATURE_AIR?"
        then, do not ask the same question for another pair of attributes.
        Hint: Interesting things might be finding trends temperatures over the years, 
        stations that stick out or group, or relations between seasons. 
      </p>
      <div class="task">
        <h3>Task 2: Questions to the dataset (36%)</h3>
        <p>
          Please, complete the html list below with your 3 questions 
          for the dataset before actually analyzing the data. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Your questions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Question 1: Is there a trend in TEMPERATURE_AIR within a year ?
            </li>
            <li>
              Question 2: Do these SUNSHINE_DURATION, PRESSURE_AIR and HUMIDITY affect TEMPERATURE_AIR within a year ?
            </li>
            <li>
              Question 3: What is the average TEMPERATURE_AIR for each station ?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>Analyse the Data</h3>
      
      <p>
        Then, use the <emph>vega-lite-api</emph> to analyze the weather dataset to answer your questions.
        
        Remember: Before using the <emph>vega-lite-api</emph>, you need to import 
        vega, vega-lite and the vega-lite-api and call
        <code>vl.register(vega, vegaLite, {})</code>. 
      </p>
      <div id="example">You can adapt the following base 
        example showing the time frames in which weather data
        have been recorded per weather station for 10 preselected
        stations.
      </div>
        <div class="task">
          <h3>Task 3: Analyze the Data (36%)</h3>
          <p>
            For each of your questions, provide at least 
            one chart to answer the question. Some questions 
            might need more then one chart to answer. Attach
            your chart to the <code>div</code> elements below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="q1">Question 1:</div>
        <div id="q2">Question 2:</div>
        <div id="q3">Question 3:</div>

      <h3>Exploring deeper</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have seen the data, several new questions
        might have come to your mind. More complex questions
        need more complex views to answer them. For this the 
        composite views -- so views including multiple views at 
        once like a view of the standard deviation 
        on bar charts, or max, min and average values in a line 
        chart -- are a very good choice. 
      </p>
        <div class="task">
          <h3>Task 4: Exploring deeper (28%)</h3>
          <p>
            Formulate one 
            of these more complex questions, that arose while 
            exploring the data, and try to answer it with a
            composite view.
